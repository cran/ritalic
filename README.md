**ritalic** is an R package which gives you access to
[ITALIC](https://italic.units.it/) mediated data via its [RESTful
API](https://italic.units.it/index.php?procedure=api).

**ITALIC** the Information System on Italian Lichens, makes available
information and resources about the lichens known to occur in Italy and
bordering countries. It is maintained and updated by the Research Unit
of Professor Pier Luigi Nimis, at the University of Trieste (NE Italy),
Department of Life Sciences. Most of the data are derived from the
Checklist of the Lichens of Italy by Nimis (2016), but nomenclatural and
distributional data are being continuously updated.
